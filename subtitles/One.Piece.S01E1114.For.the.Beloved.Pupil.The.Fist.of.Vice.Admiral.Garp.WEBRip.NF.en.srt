No, wait...

That's right! I shot Flower Bullets,

72
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,807

My mud puppets

The pirates can't get
anywhere near the open area.

What are these bastards?!

84
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,350
And...

85
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,060
JUSTICE

86

H-Hey... Has this open area
always been shaped like this?

88
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:43,945
What?

89
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,200
Isn't that building moving?

90

H-Hey, wait!

91
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,251
Oh, no... we can't get out of here!

92
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,676
See, you can do it if you try.

93
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,512
Now, whenever you're ready!

94
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,441
I was able to contact Prince!

95
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,652
It's all ready!

96
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,404
Vice Admiral Garp!

97
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,828
Come to the dead center!

98
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,372
Everyone, hang onto something!

99
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,252
Charge!

100
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,887
C'mon! Hurry up!

101
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,564
You came to rescue me, didn't you?

102
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,482
What?

103
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,901
Y-Yes! Of course!

104
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,239
Thank you!

105
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,450
What? D-Don't be...

106
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,375
Okay! Let's get out of here!

107
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,508
Look up!

108
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,142
What?!

109
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:44,232
What?!

110
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,569
A marine ship is flying up there!

111
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,239
Why?! How's that possible?!

112
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,573
Who's on it?!

113
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,953
Isn't it... falling towards us?

114
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,497
R-Run!

115
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,920
Look! On the ship!

116
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,093
No way! I thought he retired!

117
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,721
The legendary... hero!

118
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,729
Vice Admiral Garp!

119
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,609
Koby! I'm here to save you!

120
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,321
Run! Just run!

121
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,157
We can't... There's no way out!

122
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,872
Hey, you damn pirates!

123
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,251
He's coming! Run!

124
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,896
Vice Admiral Garp...

125
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,151
Why?! I'm not worthy enough to save...

126
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,069
You fools!

127
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:18,117
Who do you think you have kidnapped?!

128
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,378
Koby is the future of the marines!

129
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,215
And...

130
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,386
he's also my beloved pupil!

131
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,141
Galaxy...

132
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,198
Impact!

133
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,053
If we don't run, it'll crash into us!

134
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,559
Why did he come to Beehive?!

135
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,900
Cumulo-glorpus!

136
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,511
He destroyed the town with a single blow...

137
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,680
He still does that crazy stuff.

138
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,226
Damn Garp! He's insane!

139
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,520
I'll make that geezer pay!

140
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,230
Don't move, you pirates!

141
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,109
Just obey us!

142
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,821
Resistance will result in further damage!

143
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,782
Put your weapons down!

144
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,884
I'm not satisfied...

145
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,180
I'm off my game.

146
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,808
Screw you!

147
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,770
What's that I-could-do-better attitude
after causing this much destruction?!

148
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,231
We can't take any more damage!

149
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,400
Vice Admiral Garp!

150
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,903
Oh, Koby!

151
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,322
You're okay!

152
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,162
Koby, that fool...

153
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:45,926
I'm so relieved! He didn't get killed!

154
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,140
Koby-kun, I'm glad that you're okay.

155
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,892
Good work, everyone.

156
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,314
Gee... He overdid it.

157
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,900
Garp is a bad boy!

158
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,321
Garp-san said Koby's the future
of the marines. It's unforgivable!

159
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,531
I'll drag him down!

160
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:12,369
{\an8}You've got to do those things in secret.
You spoiled brat!

161
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,913
{\an8}So cute.

162
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,209
Hey!

163
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,378
Koby!

164
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,631
Captain Koby!

165
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,174
Everyone!

166
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,426
Koby-kun!

167
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,554
Come on! Let's go home!

168
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,141
Helmeppo-san! Tashigi-san!

169
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,810
Even those who are not SWORD members...

170
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,314
Everyone likes you, Koby-<i>senpai</i>!

171
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,401
Why are you carrying that, Koby?

172
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,904
Looks like it's hard to run with it.

173
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,072
Vice Admiral Garp!

174
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,699
We can't get the shackle removed...

175
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,910
And we didn't know what to do!

176
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,876
Please...

177
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,628
do...

178
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,882
some...

179
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,802
thin'...

180
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,809
Hibari!

181
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,018
Hibari-san!

182
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,690
Hibari-san!

183
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,495
You fools...

184
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,540
What do you think you have done?

185
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,178
Kuzan.

186
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,139
Kuzan-san!

187
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,351
What are you doing?! Thaw out Hibari-san!

188
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,063
He's Aokiji!

189
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,983
Captain Kuzan!

190
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,943
Kuzan-chan!

191
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,114
Kuzan-san! I'm begging you!

192
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,866
It's no use.

193
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,414
Don't get me into trouble, Koby.

194
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,875
I can't have you running off...

195
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,210
while Teach is away.

196
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,091
<i>Two years ago,</i>

197
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,804
<i>over the position of the Marine
Headquarters' next Admiral of the Fleet,</i>

198
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,391
<i>a big fight erupted
between Admiral Akainu...</i>

199
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,603
<i>and Admiral Aokiji.</i>

200
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,903
<i>After 10 days of a deadly struggle,
the victory went to...</i>

201
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,490
<i>Akainu.</i>

202
00:17:55,532 --> 00:18:00,871
<i>Akainu didn't kill Aokiji out of mercy.</i>

203
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:06,543
<i>However,
Aokiji refused to serve under Akainu.</i>

204
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,463
<i>And he left the marines.</i>

205
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,847
{\an8}SOME ISLAND, NEW WORLD

206
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,710
What the...

207
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,421
Blackbeard's here!

208
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,133
Run! Get out of the town!

209
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,134
Hey!

210
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,344
What happened here?

211
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,305
Wait! Who did this?!

212
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,770
No, I don't need to ask...

213
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:13,652
There is only one person in the world
who can do this!

214
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,072
It's you!

215
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,116
Aokiji!

216
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:36,341
{\an8}My crew is frozen solid outside! Undo it!

217
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,678
You're annoying me.

218
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,016
You better not use
your Tremor-Tremor Fruit power.

219
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,227
They'll shatter and die.

220
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,441
You're their captain, so I think you know.

221
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,111
Do you think I started it?

222
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,948
And you also know what happened to me,
don't you?

223
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,620
I'm broken-hearted and angry.

224
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,750
So imagine whose fault it actually is.

225
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:22,262
<i>How far I have run</i>

226
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:29,895
<i>Without knowing it, I counted scars</i>

227
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:36,902
<i>A treasure map in my head all along</i>

228
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:43,408
<i>Still looking for the future</i>

229
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:50,123
<i>The real promise</i>

230
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:56,964
<i>Lies much deeper in my heart</i>

231
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,592
<i>A dream</i>

232
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:06,431
<i>That no one can catch up with</i>

233
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:11,728
<i>That's all I hold on to</i>

234
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:19,236
<i>To you who smiles like the sun</i>

235
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:26,159
<i>I'll sing the same song as that day</i>

236
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:33,208
<i>This wish I don't want to forget
Even when I grow up</i>

237
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:40,299
<i>Until it reaches you</i>

238
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,727
<i>"Dive into the Sea of Information!
The Punk Records Library!"</i>

239
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:58,817
Hi, I'm Lilith, one of the Satellites of
Dr. Vegapunk, the genius scientist!

240
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,945
I'm Edison, also Vegapunk!

241
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,865
Today we'll introduce this one! Helmeppo!

242
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,618
{\an8}He is a lieutenant commander and a member
of SWORD, a top secret special force!

243
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:13,999
He was born on July 16th
and likes caviar and luxurious steak!

244
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,501
He is the son of a former marine
branch captain, Axe-Hand Morgan...

245
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,047
{\an8}who was the reigning tyrant of
Shells Town.

246
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,342
{\an8}He used to boss people around
using his father's influence.

247
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,219
One day,
he had Zoro arrested unreasonably.

248
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:30,307
He promised Zoro that he'd free him
if he could survive without food or drink

249
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,102
for a month, but he broke
his word and tried to execute Zoro.

250
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,315
Then he and his father got beaten
by the angry Luffy and Zoro.

251
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,277
He joined the marines and spent his days
doing odd jobs with Koby.

252
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,322
Seems like he mended his ways.

253
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,866
He is now flourishing
as a lieutenant commander.

254
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,118
When Koby was kidnapped by Blackbeard,

255
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,954
Helmeppo raised his voice
to take him back.

256
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,707
I'm begging you guys!

257
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,667
We're comrades!

258
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:03,673
We alone can't possibly save him!

259
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,636
Helmeppo is shining brighter now
than he used to.

260
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,471
That's it for today!

261
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,016
Now that you've seen it,
donate to our research fund!

262
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,852
See you next time!

263
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,736
<i>Kuzan stands in the way of Garp
who came to save Koby.</i>

264
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,906
<i>What is his true intention

265
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,407
<i>after leaving the marines?</i>

266
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,993
<i>Garp's former best pupil,

267
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,997
<i>now unleashes a blow of rebellion
